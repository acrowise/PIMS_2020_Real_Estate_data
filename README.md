<h3>A brief description of Data:</h3>

City: Calgary, AB

A sample of 4,000 residential properties in Calgary, AB, Canada is in file <em>"sampel_property_value.csv"</em>. One interesting research topic that can be attempted here is: how is investment on residential properties affected by macro- as well as micro-economic factors, from 2017 to 2020?


macro-economic factors that influence all property values, regardless of property-specific details such as # of bdr's or location, in file "econ.csv", include:
	inf1=inflation
	mor1=mortgage rate 5 year


other geographically relevant factors that also drive property values include:

(1) demographics ("demographics.csv"): population: pop1-5, language: lan1-2, income: inc1-4, house ownership: own1-4, and labor: lab1-3

(2) safety ("safety.csv"): neighbourhood safety: saf1-8
